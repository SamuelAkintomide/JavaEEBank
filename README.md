### Description
Developed a Java-based banking application that simulates essential banking operations, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transaction history tracking. The application follows object-oriented programming principles, implementing custom data structures and sorting/searching algorithms for optimised performance. It includes exception handling for secure transactions and a user-friendly interface for intuitive interactions. The system ensures data persistence through file handling or a database, maintaining user account details and transaction logs efficiently.
